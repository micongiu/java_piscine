# Learning Java Through Practical Exercises

This repository documents my journey through a series of Java exercises designed to build a strong foundation in the language, covering fundamental concepts from basic syntax to advanced multithreading and I/O operations.

## Module 00: Java Basics

This module focused on the core building blocks of Java programming.

* **`day_00.ex00`: Summing Digits of a Number**
    * I learned how to manipulate numbers as strings, extract individual digits, and perform basic arithmetic.
    * Key concepts: Data types, type conversion, string manipulation, character handling, and basic arithmetic.
* **`day_00.ex01`: Primality Test**
    * I gained experience in writing functions, handling user input, implementing algorithms, and optimizing them using mathematical insights.
    * Key concepts: Input, error handling, conditional statements, functions, loops, mathematical functions, boolean logic, and output.

## Module 01: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Collections

This module delved into OOP principles and the use of Java collections.

* **Exercise 00: User and Transaction Management**
    * I learned how to create classes and objects, implement encapsulation, use constructors, manage object state, handle errors with exceptions, and use enums and UUIDs.
    * Key concepts: Classes, objects, encapsulation, constructors, object state, methods, error handling, enums, UUIDs, and overriding `toString()`.
* **Exercise 01: Unique ID Generator (Singleton)**
    * I implemented the Singleton pattern to ensure unique user IDs, and practiced using read-only fields.
    * Key concepts: Singleton pattern, read-only fields, and ID generation.
* **Exercise 02: Dynamic User List (Array-based)**
    * I learned how to create and implement interfaces, use array-based data structures, handle dynamic array resizing, and create custom exceptions.
    * Key concepts: Interfaces, array-based data structures, dynamic array resizing, custom exceptions, and exception handling.
* **Exercise 03: Transactions Management (Linked List)**
    * I learned how to use Linked lists, and how to create a good transaction management system.
    * Key concepts: Linked Lists, Transaction Management, and advanced error handling.

## Module 02: Java I/O and Files

This module explored Java's capabilities for handling input/output operations and file manipulation.

* **Exercise 00: File Signature Analysis**
    * I gained experience in reading and writing files, processing file signatures (magic numbers), using character encoding, and working with hexadecimal conversions.
    * Key concepts: Java I/O streams, file handling, character encoding, data structures (HashMap), command-line I/O, file appending, and hexadecimal conversion.

## Module 03: Java Threads

This module introduced multithreading and concurrency in Java.

* **Exercise 00: Basic Multithreading (Egg and Hen)**
    * I learned how to create and start threads, use `CountDownLatch` for thread synchronization, and use `join()` to wait for thread completion.
    * Key concepts: Thread creation, shared data and immutability, thread synchronization (CountDownLatch), thread joining (`join()`), command-line arguments, error handling, and concurrency.
* **Exercise 01: Thread Communication (SynchronousQueue)**
    * I practiced thread communication using `SynchronousQueue` and implemented a simple Producer-Consumer pattern.
    * Key concepts: Thread communication, Producer-Consumer pattern, and thread synchronization (SynchronousQueue).
* **Exercise 02: Thread Pools and Array Summation**
    * I learned how to use `ExecutorService` for thread pools, the `Runnable` interface, `AtomicInteger` for thread-safe operations, and array segmentation for parallel processing.
    * Key concepts: Thread pools (ExecutorService), Runnable interface, atomic variables (AtomicInteger), array segmentation, command-line arguments, thread termination, exception handling, and random array generation.
* **Exercise 03: Concurrent File Downloads**
    * I learned how to download files using multithreading, how to properly use a thread pool for network operations, and how to manage shared resources in a thread-safe way.
    * Key concepts: File I/O, networking (HttpURLConnection), command-line arguments, error handling, file extension extraction, and thread safety.

## Overall Learning

Through these exercises, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of Java's core features, including:

* Object-oriented programming principles.
* Data structures and collections.
* File I/O and handling.
* Multithreading and concurrency.
* Error handling and exception management.
* How to read and parse command line arguments.
